# Siamese Convolutional Neural Network

Siamese Convolutional Neural Network for the Classification  of Peach Leaves. The dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rWCr9DrknoK0HKFhNRavCVgZ5UKjU3hi. The experiments developed were
apploed on the 224x224 variant of the dataset. The architectures discussed in the paper have been 
separated into different colab notebooks, each having the following names:

### Replication of benchmark architecture
siamese_network_benchmark.ipynb

### Proposed architecture ReLU variant
siamese_network_pa_relu.ipynb

### Proposed architecture LReLU variant
siamese_network_pa_lrelu.ipynb

### Proposed architecture ELU variant
siamese_network_pa_elu.ipynb

### Pre-trained model ResNet50 
siamese_network_pm_resnet50.ipynb

### Pre-trained model DenseNet121 
siamese_network_pm_densenet121.ipynb

### Pre-trained model EfficientNetB0
